# Stock-Price-Dashboard

The project gives buy and sell signals there is also an analysis part which cannot be displayed due to api limitations in the free version still i have made that part to edit the code further 
The project is totally dependent on API of Finnhub and Yfinance both of them crash sometimes so its not always a succesful run.
The lstm Model needs to be trained and it gives most accurate signals on 1 hr candlesticks rest all are semi accurate
